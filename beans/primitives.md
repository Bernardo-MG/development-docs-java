# Primitives

Basic values such as int, short or boolean are primitives. These are defined with reserved keywords, which have only lower case letters.

## Wrappers

All the primitives have an equivalent object, for example the wrapper for int is Integer, and the one for boolean is Boolean. It is recommended using wrappers instead of primitives.
