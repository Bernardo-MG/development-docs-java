# Setting Up the JAR

By default Maven generates small artifacts, which will be missing things such as javadocs, sources and manifest. These are commonly offered, and sometimes required, when publishing projects, as they offer a minimum of documentation.

They can be added with a bit of configuration, and a few Maven plugins.
