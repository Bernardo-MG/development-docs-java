# Theme

On Maven themes are called skins. By default the site makes use of an ugly and obsolete UI. It is recommended using the [docs Maven skin](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin). With this theme the site becomes an HTML5 mobile-friendly page.

More skins can be found in the [Maven Skins page](https://maven.apache.org/skins/index.html).
