# Theme

By default the site is generated using an ugly and obsolete UI. For that reason the [docs Maven skin](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin) is used. With this theme the generated site becomes an HTML5 mobile-friendly page.

More skins can be found in the [Maven Skins page](https://maven.apache.org/skins/index.html).
