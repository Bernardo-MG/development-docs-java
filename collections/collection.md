# Collection

A generic interface for groups of objects. Used as a base interface for most traversable collections.

## Operations

* Add
* Remove
* Check existence

## Traversing

As it inherits from Iterable it can be iterated and used in for-each loops.

Additionally it can be operated with a stream:

```java
strings.stream();
```
