# Map

Maps keys to values.

## Operations

* Setting the value for a key
* Checking a key's existence

## Getting the keys and values

The map offers a few methods to acquire the keys and values all together.

To get all the keys:

map.keySet();
```

To get all the values:

```java
map.values();
```

To get both the keys and the values:

```java
map.entrySet();
```
