# Libraries

## Test Frameworks

The test frameworks available for Java are:

* [Junit](https://github.com/bernardo-mg/development-docs/tree/607d3a34739325f64d3fc216771c0bc79458f781/java/junit.org) \(recommended\)
* [TestNG](https://github.com/bernardo-mg/development-docs/tree/607d3a34739325f64d3fc216771c0bc79458f781/java/testng.org)

Junit integrates quick with Spring, Eclipse and any additional framework or library needed for the tests.

## Mocking

[Mockito](https://github.com/bernardo-mg/development-docs/tree/607d3a34739325f64d3fc216771c0bc79458f781/java/site.mockito.org) can be used for mocking dependencies.
