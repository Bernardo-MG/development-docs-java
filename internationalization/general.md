# General

The ResourceBundle class takes care of translations:

```java
ResourceBundle messages;

messages = ResourceBundle.getBundle("MessagesBundle");

messages.getString("greetings");
```

Remember that not only texts, but other things such as currencies or times, can require internationalization.
